		<p class="lead">This is a simple API Mashup. Write an author of a
			song, and a title into the fields and check what is the sentiment of
			the text in the song. The scale stretches from -1 (very negative), to
			+1 (very positive).</p><p class="lead">Additional list with authors and songs will also be presented after successful submit (and server availability)</p>
			<p class="lead">	Song examples:<br>coldplay - Adventure of a Lifetime<br> Louis Armstrong - What a wonderful world <br>
			OutKast - Hey Ya!

		Idea behind the app is to know on the fly the sentiment of a song, and to find other songs with similar tone. The sentiment is based on the text in a particular song.  This mash-up is made of 3 different APIs. The first one is responsible for finding text of a song based on the author and a song name. It can be found here https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#. The second app takes the lyrics and calculates the sentiment. This one can be found here https://sentim-api.herokuapp.com/. Last one takes the text and searches its database for different songs with similar text. Last API can be found here https://searchly.asuarez.dev/. JavaScript makes connecting to APIs very easy with a fetch() function. It can be a very fruitful endeavour  to try to mash-up different APIs. Such experimentation with different APIs helps in learning core javaScript. This mash-up was born from the idea of finding similar texts. The sentiment idea, which became the central point of the API was an add-on in the beginning. Now it is possible to search for favourite song, and songs alike, and see the sentiment of all of them. </p>
